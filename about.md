I am Andrew Kenneth MacLeay, Esq.  I am a software developer
residing near Boston, Massachusetts.

I work at [athenaHealth](https://www.athenahealth.com) building web applications to help patients engage in their health care.

My real life interests primarily revolve around the natural world - I am fascinated with the plants and animals of the New England area.
