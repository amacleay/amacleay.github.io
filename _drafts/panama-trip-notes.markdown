Let's just catalogue the trip as it goes.

## January 30, 2017, morning

I'm on my way to Bastimentos, an island (or group of islands?) in Panama's Bocas del Toro province.  For this trip, I decided fairly early on to keep the travel portion as short as possible in order to maximize my time in Bastimentos: flights only, relatively short layovers.  This does mean that the ratio of my "vacation time" to time away from home is maximized, but it also means that I'll be skirting many of the typical travel experiences and seeing much less variety.  It means that I'm having more experiences with airport staff and fewer with taxi drivers; more with tourist professionals and fewer with locals; more English speaking, wealthy, comfortable; fewer Spanish, diverse, and exciting.  Halfway through the trip out, I feel as though I'm missing out on one of my favorite parts of traveling, which is struggling with and getting acclimated to another language.  On the other hand, this is easy.  Add that to the pile of evidence that the easier a thing is, the less desirable it probably is as well.

But it's easy, and I'll take it for now.

Last night, I got to Boston's Logan airport around 4pm.  Soon after, I read on twitter that a significant protest had gathered around the international terminal over the Trump administration's executive order to prevent entry to nationals from some Middle Eastern countries - the so-called Seven Nations Ban.  Not until the morning of the next day (as I write this in a little cafe in the Panama City Albrook Airport) did I find out that Customs agents had detained - pursuant to the illegal executive order - two UMass Darmouth professors at Logan as I sat there.  That hits so very close to home: I am an alumnus of the UMass system, tons of friends went to UMD, and these people were being held on the same property I was sitting on.  Only last week, this same sense of narrowly missing the opportunity to be part of historic events hit me hard, during the women's march, and it feels like an opportunity lost.  I shouldn't be _near_ these historic events, I should be _in_ them.  It feels cowardly to desire to be part of history but to let it pass by at such a close proximity.  Unfortunately, such opportunities are coming fast and furious these days: the President is an enemy to many of the core political and moral values I hold, and I'm far from alone.  I will have many more opportunities to get involved directly and put myself on the right side of history.

If you are traveling, you should be busy experiencing _that_, not getting lost in the Twittersphere back home thousands of miles away, but here I am: four hours too early to check in for my flight from Panama City to Bocas del Toro, rabidly consuming all the media I can find from the [local ACLU](ACLU-MA), thousands of miles away.  What else could I be doing?  Looking up the history of the [places](hist-noriega) I'm [visiting](albrook) is a depressing look into my nation's [imperialist past](hist-canal), while I'm obsessing over the fight for its future.

Oh well.  Maybe I'll order a _cafe con leche_ in Spanish this time while I refresh the page.

## Late morning

I've read the majority of _H Is for Hawk_ on this leg of the journey - one of the perks of drawn-out but uninvolved travel.  Macdonald has put together a quite involved book, weaving a number of distinct threads - the journey of raising a goshawk and hunting with her, the death of her father, and her commentary on the two famous falconry-related British books of the last century, _The Peregrine_ and _The Goshawk_; the analysis of the latter - and its author, T. H. White, who more famously wrote _The Once and Future King_ - of which forms the basis for much of her content.  The material, to me, hangs together somewhat loosely, more like a collection of essays assembled like a mixtape than a coherent narrative, but that's not a serious problem.  There is just one thing that distracts me from losing myself in the book.

To my mind, the framework of Sigmund Freud is to psychology what Marx's is to political theory - wonderfully capable of providing a stirring narrative explanation, often illuminating and always intriguing, but in the end, too broad of application and too narrow of opinion to be seriously considered as dependable frames of reference.  By that, I mean it has a fairly small and reductive set of rules, but can be applied in a very wide range of critiques which perhaps stretch those rules beyond their capacity, as though it were a flat-bottomed boat designed for a certain number of passengers but carrying many more than could actually fit.  Macdonald's reading of White's life is replete with Freudian analyses, and what troubles me most is when it applies to his homosexuality.  Somehow, at every turn, White's brutal childhood metamorphoses into all of his adult troubles: alcoholism, sadism, pedophilia, angst over his impossible homosexuality.  I _don't_ think Macdonald is saying that somehow being unloved as a child turned him gay, but I _do_ think she is saying that his childhood is a critical part of his later alcoholism, among other things.  The problem I find with this kind of attempt to tie youthful trauma to adult disorder is that it is ultimately unscientific - how could one disprove the hypothesis? - and so ultimately it gives us tools for labeling various states of being as pathologies to be explained by previous events.  In the particular case of alcoholism, I believe we know emphatically that it is not simply a phenomenon of the psyche, because it has a strong genetic component (citation needed, I realize).  Without a great deal more rigor, what's to prevent someone, using the same tools as Macdonald uses to construct her commentary, from calling his homosexuality a stress-induced pathology as well?

Not that this is stopping me in any way, mind you.  My flight to Bocas del Toro boards in an hour and a half, and I expect I'll have finished the book by the time I arrive.  There's much more I enjoy in _H Is for Hawk_ than dislike.
